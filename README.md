# The Archimedeans

> The Archimedeans website, written in Django

## Usage

Make sure you have Python and Django installed, then you can run

```shell
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py createsuperuser # Follow the prompts
$ python manage.py runserver
```


## Notes

Currently the rest of the website is not implemented, just the member management system (and only from the Django admin panel, at the moment).
