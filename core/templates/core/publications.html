<h1>Publications</h1>
<p>The Archimedeans maintains a few (hopefully) annual publications.</p>
<h2 id="freshers-guide">Freshers' Guide</h2>

<!-- TODO: TEMPLATE -->

<p>Years of experience and knowledge have been passed down and compressed into this, the Holy Grail of guidance for Freshers, available as a <a href="/files/publications/altguide.pdf">PDF</a>. This guide is produced by the Archimedeans and sent to all the first years before they come to Cambridge. If you feel that there needs to be some changes to what is said, please <a href="/contact">inform us</a> so that we ensure the freshers are as well informed as they can be.</p>



<h2 id="eureka">Eureka</h2>

<!-- TODO: TEPLATE <?php include_once("./eureka/about.php");?> -->

<p>Further information about <a href="/eureka/subscribe">subscription</a>, <a
href="/eureka/contributing">contributing</a> and <a
href="/eureka/advertising">advertising</a> can be found on separate pages.</p>

<p>Digital copies of old issues are found in our <a href="/eureka/archive/">archive</a> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/eureka-magazine">mirror</a>).</p>

<h2 id="qarch">QARCH</h2>
<a href="/files/publications/qarch-112.pdf">

</a>

<p>QARCH is a publication of problems, of varying difficulty (from answer easy,
to answer hard, to answer unknown!). The latest version is available <a
href="/files/publications/qarch-112.pdf"> here</a>.</p>

<p>Please send in your submissions (full or partial solutions, new problems,
comments or queries) to <a
href="mailto:archim-qarch-editor@srcf.net">archim-qarch-editor@srcf.net</a> or
to the Archimedeans' pigeonhole at the CMS. Items sent by post should be
addressed as follows: </p>
<address>
Editor of QARCH<br>
The Archimedeans<br>
Centre for Mathematical Sciences<br>
Wilberforce Road<br>
Cambridge<br>
CB3 0WA
</address>
<p>There is very little restriction on the type of question suitable for
publication and discussion in these pages, except that the statement and (if
known) the solution be relatively concise. Problems may be submitted with or
without known solutions.</p>

<p>If you wish to discuss a problem in more detail, or to write something
unrelated but of a mathematical nature, don't forget the Archimedeans' other
journal, Eureka, which welcomes articles on all aspects of mathematics as well
as mathematical fiction, poetry, artwork, etc. Contact the editor, either by
email at <a
href="mailto:archim-eureka-editor@srcf.net">archim-eureka-editor@srcf.net</a> or
by post to the address above, for more details.</p>
