<h3>Paul Taylor's Original Introduction</h3><br/>
<pre> This pds is intended to contain the entirety of my knowledge
about the past officers of the Archimedeans and related bodies.
It would be appreciated if future Archimedeans Committees would
make a point of (i) keeping it up to date and (ii) making
additions and corrections to it on the basis of any further
information which might subsequently come their way.

Since the lists have been compiled from a large variety of
sources, it is impossible to give them any "legal" significance.
In particular one cannot infer from the presence
of a particular person that he/she actually performed the
appropriate duties, or from succession whether the previously
named holder fulfilled the term of office, resigned or was
removed. In many cases several people shared duties, and are
listed with the same date, whilst occasional resignations
have occurred, in which case the replacement is listed.

For the time being, please do not make corrections directly
to this pds yourself, but SEND them as messages to me (PT16),
or add pds members called #CORRnnn with nnn running
sequentially from 003 and the date included in the text.
This is intended to avoid version problems.
