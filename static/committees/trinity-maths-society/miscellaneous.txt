(Lists based on minutes volumes 1 to 11, 1919-1997; gaps 1993-5.)

Dictator
1940 Smith, C.A.B.

Senior Treasurer
1952 Besicovitch, A.S. (?)
1982 Proctor, M.R.E.
1996 Norman, A.C.
Note: the only mention of a Senior Treasurer in volumes 1 to 10 seems
to be at meeting 321a on 28 April 1952 where it was asked who the
Senior Treasurer was and the President thought that it was Professor
Besicovitch and would look into the matter for next year's programme
cards.  The next card did not have a Senior Treasurer printed on it.
The post has not been in the constitution; Imre Leader says the Senior
Treasurer in his time was Dr Proctor.  The only mention in volume 11
seems to be a list of people at the dinner on 22 February 1996
(meeting 663) identifying A.C. Norman as Senior Treasurer, which he
continues to be as of 2010, but he does not remember when he became
Senior Treasurer or who his predecessor was.
