PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE CONSTITUTION

David Collier 17/2/04

I propose the following amendments to the changes which were proposed by Jordan Skittrall on 17/2/04:


1. Regarding Proposed Constitutional Change 6, changes to section 12:

This part of the proposal should be removed completely, with the effect that section 12 of the constitution will be left unaltered.

[Explanation: It is my sincerely held opinion that the proposed change is ridiculous.]


2. Regarding Proposed Constitutional Change 11, changes to section 3 item 4.

The paragraph of the proposal beginning "to add after the word "cases" the words..." should be removed completely, and instead section 3 item 4(a) should be replaced by the following:

The Committee decides that the College Society shall not continue to be recognised as an affiliated College Society because of a failure to comply with one of the two previous paragraphs.

[Explanation: The spirit of the proposal is unaltered, but I think this wording is better. In addition, the original proposal meant that disaffiliation was not automatic if a College Society failed to comply with item 3, and this amendment makes the same change with respect to item 2.]
