   any Society or other body which has not formally  requested
   such  recognition  on  a date at least one year and one day
   before the passage of the formal  motion  recognising  that
   Society,  except  that  in the case of a recognised College
   Society changing its name or dividing to form two  or  more
   Societies, or in the case of two or more recognised College
   Societies amalgamating, the Committee may recognise at once
   any of these Societies as College Societies at its discret-
   ion,  so long as the aims, corporate membershio, assets and
   liabilities  of  the new Society or Societies are identical
   to those of the dissolved one(s).

   either:
    i)   it dissolves itself, or
    ii)  it fails to hold a meeting during any academic  year,
          or
    iii) it is disaffiliated by a General  Meeting;  this  may
          only be done if
           a) 14 days' notice has been given  to  the  College
               Society of its proposed disaffiliation, and
           b) two-thirds of the Members present and voting are
