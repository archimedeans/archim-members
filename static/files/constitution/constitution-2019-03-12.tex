\appendix
\section{Single transferable vote procedure for the election of officers}

(Adapted from the University Statutes and Ordinances, 2016)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every elector in giving their vote:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item must enter on the voting paper (see diagram), against the figure 1,
  the name of the candidate to whom they give first preference;
  \item may in addition enter on the voting-paper, against the figures 2, 3,
  and so on, the names of any other candidates in order of preference.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
Order of preference  & Candidate \\ \hline
1                    &           \\ \hline
2                    &           \\ \hline
3                    &           \\ \hline
4                    &           \\ \hline
5                    &           \\ \hline
6                    &           \\ \hline
7                    &           \\ \hline
8                    &           \\ \hline
\end{tabular}


\item A voting-paper shall not be valid unless the elector's first preference is
legibly and unambiguously expressed.
\item There shall be made available the following instructions:
Enter against the figure 1 the name of the candidate to whom you give
first preference.
You may also enter, against the figures 2, 3, and so on, the names of other
candidates in the order of your preference for them, continuing until you
are indifferent. The order of your preferences is crucial. A later preference
can be considered only if an earlier preference has been excluded because
of insufficient support.
\item \textit{Counting of votes: the first stage}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The voting-papers shall be sorted into parcels according to the first
  preferences recorded for each candidate, any invalid papers being set
  aside.
  \item The number of first preference votes for each candidate and the total
  number of valid votes (i.e. voting-papers) shall be determined.
  \item The returning officer shall then determine the number of votes sufficient to secure the election of a candidate (the â€˜quotaâ€™), by dividing
  the total number of valid votes by 2, the result being rounded up to
  the next whole number above, if it is not an exact whole number.
  \end{enumerate}
\item \textit{Election of a candidate}

If at any stage of the count a candidate is credited with a number of votes
equal to or exceeding the quota they shall be deemed to be elected,
except that, if the number of candidates attaining the quota is greater
than the number of places to be filled, the two candidates who attained
the quota at the most recent stage of the count shall be deemed not to
be elected, and the returning officer shall proceed to the next stage of the
count.
\item \textit{Counting the votes: subsequent stages}

Subsequent stages of the count shall be conducted as follows. The candidate with the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from the poll,
and their votes shall be transferred to the continuing candidates next
in order of the voters preference, in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 7 and 8. Each transfer shall be deemed to constitute a further
stage of the count.
\item \textit{The exclusion of a candidate}

If a vacancy is not filled as a result of the first preferences recorded, the
candidate or candidates credited with the smallest number or numbers of
votes shall be excluded from the poll, as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The two or more candidates credited with the smallest number of
  votes shall be excluded together if the total number of votes of such
  two or more candidates does not exceed the number of votes credited
  to the candidate with the next smallest number of votes.
  \item Otherwise, the candidate credited with the smallest number of votes
  shall be excluded if the number of votes of such a candidate does not
  exceed the number of votes credited to the candidate with the next
  smallest number of votes.
  \item If the two or more candidates credited with the smallest number of
  votes have each the same number of votes, the candidate who had the
  smallest number at the earliest stage at which they had an unequal
  number shall be excluded. If such two or more candidates have been
  credited with the same number of votes at all stages of the count, the
  returning officer shall determine by lot which candidate to exclude.
  \end{enumerate}
\item The exclusion of a candidate or candidates from the poll shall be effected
in the following manner:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The voting-papers of the candidate or candidates to be excluded shall
  be sorted into parcels according to the next available preferences
  for continuing candidates, any papers on which no next available
  preference is expressed being set aside.
  \item The returning officer shall determine the number of the papers in
  each parcel, and the number of the non-transferable papers.
  \item Each continuing candidate shall be credited with the number of
  any papers transferred to them, and the number of any non-transferable papers shall be added to the previous non-transferable
  total.
  \item After the transfer of the parcels of papers, the returning officer shall
  ascertain which candidates (if any) are deemed to be elected in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 5.
  \end{enumerate}
\item \textit{The final stages}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item When the proposed exclusion of a candidate or candidates would
  reduce the number of continuing candidates to one, the continuing
  candidate shall be deemed to be elected.
  \item When the vacancy can be filled under this regulation, no further
  transfers of votes shall be made, and the remaining continuing candidate or candidates shall be formally excluded from the poll.
  \end{enumerate}
\item In publishing the result of the election the returning officer shall include
a notification of any transfer of votes made under these regulations, and
of the total number of votes credited to each candidate after any such
transfer.
\item Any candidate or any candidateâ€™s representative may, at any time during
the counting of the votes, either before the commencement or after the
completion of any transfer of votes, request the returning officer to re-examine and recount the papers of any or all candidates (not being papers
set aside at a previous transfer as finally dealt with), and the returning
officer shall forthwith re-examine and recount the same accordingly; the
returning officer shall also have discretion to recount votes either once or
more often in any case in which they are not satisfied as to the accuracy
of any previous count; provided that nothing contained in this regulation
shall make it obligatory for the returning officer to recount the same votes
more than once.
\item If any question shall arise in relation to any transfer of votes, the decision
of the returning officer, whether expressed or implied by their acts,
shall be final.
\item For the purposes of these regulations an Ordinary Member who is not
standing in any election, appointed by the person chairing the meeting at
which the elections are held, shall be the returning officer.
\item In these regulations:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item `valid voting-paper' means a voting-paper on which a first or an only
  preference is legibly and unambiguously expressed;
  \item `invalid voting-paper' means a voting-paper on which no first preference is expressed, or on which any first preference is void for uncertainty;
  \item `continuing candidate' means a candidate not yet elected and not
  excluded from the poll;
  \item `next available preference' means the next preference in order, passing
  over any earlier preferences for candidates who have already been
  excluded;
  \item `transferable paper' means a voting-paper on which a next available
  preference for a continuing candidate is legibly and unambiguously
  expressed;
  \item `non-transferable paper' means a voting-paper on which no next available preference for a continuing candidate is expressed, or on which
  any next available preference is void for uncertainty.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
